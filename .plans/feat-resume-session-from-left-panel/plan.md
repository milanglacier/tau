Goal: implement “resume from old session” so selecting a historical session in the left sidebar opens/selects an editable Tau tab backed by a new `pi --mode rpc --session <file>` child, while selecting the same session again focuses the existing tab instead of creating a duplicate.

Answer on semantics: yes — the proposed semantics are clear and fit the existing Tau model. A Tau tab already represents one active backend Pi session, so “old session click => live tab for that session; duplicate click => focus existing tab” is a clean invariant. Implementation is moderate, not hard, because the server already manages live sessions and the client already checks `liveSessions` by `sessionFile`; the main missing pieces are spawning Pi with `--session`, adding an idempotent resume API, and changing sidebar selection from read-only history loading to resume-or-focus.

Key findings from local inspection:
- `src/public/app-main.ts` currently handles sidebar selection with `handleSessionSelect()` -> `switchSession()`. In standalone mode it renders historical JSONL read-only, then only selects a live tab if `liveSessions.find(s => s.sessionFile === sessionFile)` already exists.
- `src/server/sessions.ts` owns `PiRpcSession` and `LiveSessionManager.create()`. `PiRpcSession.start()` currently spawns `pi --mode rpc` and optionally `--model`, but has no resume/session-file option.
- `src/server/server-main.ts` already has safe session-file validation through `resolveSessionFile()`, session listing/parsing, and `/api/live-sessions` create/list/delete/snapshot routes.
- `pi --help` confirms the CLI supports `--session <path|id>` for using a specific session file and `--fork` for a fork. This feature should use `--session`, not `--fork`, because the requested behavior is resume, not branch.

Implementation plan:

1. Add backend support for a resumed live session.
   - In `src/server/sessions.ts`, extend `PiRpcSession` constructor options with an optional `sessionFile` and optional initial `entries`/`sessionName`.
   - Store a normalized/resolved session file on `this.sessionFile` before startup when provided.
   - In `PiRpcSession.start()`, append `--session <sessionFile>` to the spawned `pi` args when `this.sessionFile` is set, preserving existing `--mode rpc` and `--model` behavior.
   - Keep normal new-session behavior unchanged when no session file is provided.

2. Add server-side resume/idempotency API.
   - Prefer a dedicated route: `POST /api/live-sessions/resume` with body `{ filePath: string, cwd?: string, model?: string }`.
   - In `src/server/server-main.ts`, validate `filePath` with existing `resolveSessionFile()` so only JSONL files under `SESSIONS_DIR` can be resumed.
   - Before creating anything, check `liveManager.sessions` for a session whose `sessionFile` resolves to the same file. If found, return `{ session: existing.metadata(), reused: true }`.
   - Determine the cwd from, in order: validated `body.cwd` if usable, the session header cwd from existing `readSessionHeaderCwd()`, or the sidebar project path passed by the client. If no usable existing directory is available, return a clear 400 like “Cannot resume session because its project directory no longer exists”.
   - Create a new live session with `pi --mode rpc --session <resolvedFile>` via a new `LiveSessionManager.resume({ sessionFile, cwd, model })` method or by extending `create()` with optional `sessionFile`. A named `resume()` method is clearer.
   - Seed the session metadata with `sessionFile` immediately so broadcasts and duplicate checks work before Pi reports stats.

3. Preserve historical messages in the new live tab snapshot.
   - Add a small server helper to read JSONL entries from the resolved session file, reusing the parsing style from `serveSessionFile()`.
   - When creating a resumed session, initialize `PiRpcSession.entries` with the historical entries so `/api/live-sessions/:id/snapshot` immediately renders the old thread after `selectLiveSession()` clears the temporary loading/history view.
   - Also initialize `sessionName` from the latest `session_info.name` if available.
   - Watch for duplicate replay risk: if manual testing shows Pi RPC emits prior messages on startup, add prefix/JSON structural dedupe in `trackMessage()` or avoid seeding after confirming Pi provides history. Initial assumption: Pi does not replay history in RPC startup, so server seeding is needed.

4. Change client sidebar selection semantics.
   - In `src/public/app-main.ts`, replace the standalone-mode historical read-only branch in `switchSession()` for non-null `sessionFile` with resume-or-focus behavior.
   - First check `liveSessions.find(s => same sessionFile)`; if found, `await selectLiveSession(live.id)` and return.
   - If no live tab exists, show a transient “Resuming session…” system message and call `POST /api/live-sessions/resume` with `{ filePath: sessionFile, cwd: project?.path || session.cwd || '' }`.
   - On success, `upsertLiveSession(data.session)` and `await selectLiveSession(data.session.id)`.
   - On failure, render a clear error and leave the input disabled/read-only rather than silently showing a stale read-only transcript.
   - Keep mobile sidebar close behavior and active sidebar highlighting unchanged.
   - Remove or bypass the old “historical sessions are read-only” UX for standalone session clicks. `newSession()`/launcher/manual new-tab creation should continue to create blank sessions.

5. Normalize path matching on the client as much as possible.
   - Existing client compares raw `sessionFile` strings. Server returns absolute resolved paths, and session listing also appears to use absolute paths. Keep the simple comparison client-side.
   - Enforce true duplicate prevention on the server with `path.resolve()` comparison, so even if clients race or path formatting differs, only one live session is created for a given historical file.

6. Update tests.
   - `test/live-session-manager.test.ts`:
     - Add a test that resumed session creation passes `--session <file>` to the fake spawn args, sets `session.sessionFile`, seeds entries/name, stores the session, and broadcasts `live_session_created`.
     - Add a duplicate/idempotency test if implemented at manager level.
   - `test/http-routes.test.ts`:
     - Add `POST /api/live-sessions/resume` missing `filePath` => 400.
     - Add invalid/outside session path => 400.
     - Add valid session file with header cwd => 200, creates a live session with matching `sessionFile`.
     - Add second resume of same file => 200 with `reused: true` and no additional session in `liveManager.sessions`.
     - Add missing/nonexistent cwd in header => 400 with clear error.
   - `test/pi-rpc-session.test.ts`:
     - Add a lower-level spawn-args test for `PiRpcSession.start()` with a resume file if not already covered via manager.
     - Add snapshot/metadata coverage for pre-set `sessionFile`/seeded entries.

7. Validation commands.
   - Run `npm run typecheck`.
   - Run `npm test`.
   - Manual smoke test:
     1. Start `npm run build && node bin/tau.js` (or local tau entrypoint).
     2. Click an old session in the left sidebar.
     3. Confirm a new tab appears, the old transcript is visible, and the input is enabled.
     4. Send a follow-up message and verify it appends to the resumed session.
     5. Click the same sidebar session again and confirm focus switches to the same tab without increasing tab count.
     6. Close the tab and click the old session again; confirm a new live Pi process/tab is created for that same session file.

## Code Review — 2026-06-22

### Findings

1. **Reserve resumed files before spawning Pi**

   The duplicate prevention in `/api/live-sessions/resume` is not atomic. `src/server/server-main.ts` checks `liveManager.sessions` for an existing session at lines 351–354, but `LiveSessionManager.resume()` only inserts the new session after `await session.start()` at `/home/milanglacier/Desktop/personal-projects/tau/src/server/sessions.ts:383-384`. Two concurrent resume requests for the same historical file can both pass the check, then spawn two `pi --session <same file>` processes writing to the same JSONL. Add a per-session-file pending reservation/lock, or make manager-level resume idempotent before awaiting startup.

   Location: `/home/milanglacier/Desktop/personal-projects/tau/src/server/server-main.ts:351-367` and `/home/milanglacier/Desktop/personal-projects/tau/src/server/sessions.ts:380-384`

### Overall Assessment

Verdict: **Needs revision.**

Explanation: The main resume flow is implemented and tests pass, but the server-side idempotency guarantee can fail under concurrent clicks or multiple browser clients. That can create duplicate live sessions for one historical session file, which violates the feature invariant and risks two Pi processes appending to the same file.

### Additional Finding — Streaming tab switching

2. **Do not recreate live tabs during streaming events**

   The live tab bar is fully rebuilt for every RPC event with a `sessionId`: `src/public/app-main.ts` updates the session and calls `renderLiveTabs()` at lines 328–336, and `renderLiveTabs()` clears `liveTabsList.innerHTML` before recreating each button at lines 479–494. While an assistant is streaming, the server broadcasts frequent events and updates from `/home/milanglacier/Desktop/personal-projects/tau/src/server/sessions.ts:282-283`, so the tab button can be replaced between mouse down and mouse up and the browser may never dispatch the click. This explains why clicking an actively streaming tab can fail to focus it while idle tabs switch smoothly; update existing tab DOM in place, skip tab rerenders for non-tab-visible stream events, or throttle/defer tab rerenders so tab buttons remain stable during clicks.

   Location: `/home/milanglacier/Desktop/personal-projects/tau/src/public/app-main.ts:328-336`, `/home/milanglacier/Desktop/personal-projects/tau/src/public/app-main.ts:479-494`, and `/home/milanglacier/Desktop/personal-projects/tau/src/server/sessions.ts:282-283`

### Additional Findings — Resumed tab names

3. **Seed resumed tabs with the historical session title**

   Resumed sessions only seed `sessionName` from a `session_info` record: `/home/milanglacier/Desktop/personal-projects/tau/src/server/server-main.ts:360-365` scans the JSONL entries and leaves `sessionName` null when that record is absent. The upper tab then renders `session.sessionName || basename(session.cwd || '')` at `/home/milanglacier/Desktop/personal-projects/tau/src/public/app-main.ts:490`, while the sidebar already has a better fallback using `session.name || session.firstMessage` in `/home/milanglacier/Desktop/personal-projects/tau/src/public/session-sidebar.ts:397`. A newly-created tab can reasonably default to the project cwd, but a resumed historical session already has history and should open with the same meaningful title the sidebar can derive; otherwise old sessions appear as generic project/chat tabs even though the selected session had an identifiable title.

   Location: `/home/milanglacier/Desktop/personal-projects/tau/src/server/server-main.ts:360-365`, `/home/milanglacier/Desktop/personal-projects/tau/src/public/app-main.ts:490`, and `/home/milanglacier/Desktop/personal-projects/tau/src/public/session-sidebar.ts:397`

4. **Do not let a generic resumed title block retitling**

   `PiRpcSession.maybeTitle()` returns early whenever `this.sessionName` is truthy, so a resumed session seeded with a generic name such as `chat` will never be replaced by Tau's local title generation after the user sends a follow-up message. That makes the upper tab stay as `chat` even after new content provides a better title, unless Pi happens to emit a separate `session_name` event. Treat generic imported names as unset for local retitling, or seed resumed sessions with a meaningful historical fallback before setting `sessionName`.

   Location: `/home/milanglacier/Desktop/personal-projects/tau/src/server/sessions.ts:304-314`

## Fix Summary — 2026-06-22

Implemented fixes for the review findings without changing the prior assessment text.

- Resume creation is now idempotent at the live-session manager level. Concurrent or repeated resumes for the same resolved session file share the same pending/session result, so only one `pi --session <file>` process is spawned for that file.
- Live tab rendering now preserves existing tab button DOM nodes instead of clearing and recreating the whole tab bar on every update. This keeps tab clicks stable while a session is streaming and avoids losing clicks during high-frequency stream events.
- Resumed sessions now derive an initial tab name from historical content. The server prefers a meaningful `session_info.name`, but falls back to the first user message when the saved name is missing or generic.
- Generic imported names such as `chat`, `new chat`, `untitled`, and `session` are treated as non-meaningful so they do not block Tau's local title generation after the user sends a follow-up message.
- Added regression coverage for concurrent resume coalescing, historical-title fallback during resume, and generic `session_name` events not preventing local title generation.

Validation: `npm test` passes with 135 tests.

## Code Review — 2026-06-23 (Round 2)

### Findings

1. **Keep resumed files reserved until termination finishes**

   `LiveSessionManager.delete()` removes a resumed session from `sessions` and broadcasts `live_session_closed` before `await session.terminate(reason)` completes. Because duplicate prevention for resume only checks `findBySessionFile()` against `sessions`, a user can close a resumed tab and click the same historical session again while the old `pi --session <file>` process is still in its SIGTERM grace period, causing Tau to spawn a second Pi process for the same JSONL file. Keep a terminating session-file reservation until termination completes, or defer removing the session from the session-file index until the child is gone.

   Location: `/home/milanglacier/Desktop/personal-projects/tau/src/server/sessions.ts:418-423`

2. **Filter generic session names before updating client titles**

   The server now ignores generic `session_name` values such as `chat`, but it still forwards the raw event, and the client applies any `session_name` event directly to both the live tab state and the active sidebar title. If Pi emits `session_name: "chat"` during a resumed session, `/home/milanglacier/Desktop/personal-projects/tau/src/public/app-main.ts:334` can briefly override the tab state and `/home/milanglacier/Desktop/personal-projects/tau/src/public/app-main.ts:725-729` leaves the sidebar title as `chat`; the following sanitized `live_session_updated` metadata does not restore the sidebar DOM text. Apply the same generic-name filter on the client path, or only broadcast sanitized title events from the server.

   Location: `/home/milanglacier/Desktop/personal-projects/tau/src/public/app-main.ts:334`, `/home/milanglacier/Desktop/personal-projects/tau/src/public/app-main.ts:725-729`

### Overall Assessment

Verdict: **Needs revision.**

Explanation: The earlier duplicate-click and streaming-tab issues are addressed, and `npm test` passes. Two edge cases still undermine the resume invariant and title cleanup: a close/reopen race can temporarily create two processes for one resumed file, and generic Pi title events can still leak into client-visible titles.

## Fix Summary — 2026-06-23

Addressed the round 2 review findings without changing the existing assessment text.

- Resumed session files now remain reserved while their Pi child is terminating. If a user closes a resumed tab and immediately clicks the same historical session again, the new resume waits for the old termination to finish before spawning another `pi --session <file>` process.
- Generic Pi `session_name` events such as `chat` are now suppressed before they are broadcast to clients, so they cannot overwrite the live tab or sidebar title while still allowing Tau to generate a meaningful title from the next user message.
- Added regression coverage for resume-after-close waiting on termination and for generic `session_name` events not reaching clients.

Validation: `npm test` passes with 136 tests.

## Code Review — 2026-06-23 (Round 4)

### Findings

1. **Skip the read-only history load before resuming**

   `switchSession()` still runs the old historical-session path before the standalone resume path: it fetches `/api/sessions/:dirName/:file` and renders the JSONL at `/home/milanglacier/Desktop/personal-projects/tau/src/public/app-main.ts:1533-1548`, then clears that work and starts the real resume request at lines 1569-1574. Since `selectLiveSession()` fetches the resumed tab snapshot again, every sidebar resume now performs two full history loads and waits for the read-only one before spawning/focusing the live tab. Large sessions will open noticeably slower and flash a transcript that is immediately discarded; skip this block when `isMirrorMode` is true.

   Location: `/home/milanglacier/Desktop/personal-projects/tau/src/public/app-main.ts:1533-1574`

### Overall Assessment

Verdict: **Needs revision.**

Explanation: The server-side duplicate and title issues from the earlier rounds are addressed, and `npm test` passes with 136 tests. The client still performs the obsolete read-only history load before every standalone resume, which adds avoidable latency and visual jank to the core flow.

## Fix Summary — 2026-06-23 (Round 4)

Addressed the round 4 review finding without changing the existing assessment text.

- The standalone resume path now runs before the old read-only history path, so clicking a historical session in standalone mode goes directly to focusing an existing live tab or calling `/api/live-sessions/resume`.
- The obsolete pre-resume `/api/sessions/:dirName/:file` fetch and temporary read-only render are skipped in standalone mode; the resumed live tab snapshot remains the single source used to render historical entries.
- Renamed the misleading `isMirrorMode` client flag to `isStandaloneMode` and updated its definition comment to reflect the current architecture: Tau is connected to a standalone server that owns live Pi RPC sessions.

Validation: `npm run typecheck` and `npm test` pass with 136 tests.
